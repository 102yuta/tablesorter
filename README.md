tablesorter is a jQuery plugin for turning a standard HTML table with THEAD and TBODY tags into a sortable table without page refreshes.
tablesorter can successfully parse and sort many types of data including linked data in a cell.

#### <a name="v3.0">Version 3.0.0 beta</a>

* Note!
  * Version 3 will be modularized so that the core plugin will only deal with widgets &amp; contain some basic utility functions which are used by various widgets. Yes, this means sorting will also become a widget.
  * This is still in beta, so I have yet to rename/reorganize the options.
  * Documentation has not been updated!
  * Please don't open a new issue, add any comments and/or suggestions to [issue #122](https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter/issues/122).
  * I am open-minded &amp; I will listen to any and all of your valuable feedback!
* Plugin restructured to not use "new" - anticipating making the plugin compatible with Zepto.
* Plugin reorganized
  * Moved almost all functions into "categories": widgets, parsers, build, sort &amp; utility.
  * Renamed a bunch of functions so everything makes more sense (e.g. `$.tablesorter.addWidget` is now `$.tablesorter.widget.add`; major functions like this are mapped back to `addWidget` to ease you into this version)
  * Updated all parsers &amp; widgets to use the updated function names - I might have missed some.
  * Updated tests
